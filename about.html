    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
    Ethiopia opted to expand higher education, on the premise that education is a weapon to eradicate poverty. In recognition to this fundamental principle, 11 new universities have been established in the second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II). Injibara University was established as one of these universities. The cornerstone of the university was laid down on the 8th February 2015 in the presence of His Excellency Demeke Mekonnen, Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. It then officially established by the Council of Ministers on 4th November 2015.

Injibara University is situated in Awi Zone which is one of the 10 administrative zones of Amhara National Regional State. The zone is bordered on the west by Metekel Zone, on the north by North Gondar Zone and on the east by West Gojam. The name of the university has been picked from the name of the administrative town center of Awi Zone. The people of Awi have traditionally practiced a land-management system which is well adapted to the local ecology that enables them to sustain fertility and minimize erosion of the soil.
